# W3C TPAC Template
Unsure why this isn't in the W3C Repo. I've copied the [zip file from the Template page](https://www.w3.org/2025/Talks/TPAC/Templates/) to here so that it is easier to track.

## Clone this repo
The easiest way to make presentations for TPAC will be to just clone a repo (like this one) and then make your changes in GitHub. This way it can be better shared with others before/durring/after the event. 

## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages makes the hosting easy. This of course can all be served locally too, as it is just HTML.
