# W3C TPAC Template
Unsure why this isn't in the W3C Repo. I've copied the [zip file from the Template page](https://www.w3.org/2025/Talks/TPAC/Templates/) to here so that it is easier to track.

## My copy of the template
[Overview.html](https://mgifford.github.io/w3c-tpac-template/Templates/Overview.html)

The presentation starts with an overview. To start the presentation, press play (at the bottom).

## Clone this repo
The easiest way to make presentations for TPAC will be to just clone a repo (like this one) and then make your changes in GitHub. This way it can be better shared with others before/durring/after the event. 

## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages makes the hosting easy. This of course can all be served locally too, as it is just HTML. 

## Questions
I don't know what the difference is between the [W3C's b6+](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) and [Shower](https://shwr.me/), or why one would use one or the other.
